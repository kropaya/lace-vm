HAIL eg sections, functions, closures, names, GOTs, const and initialisation
sections, raw pages etc.

mmap/munmap - allocation/deallocation

labels

codegen/a MOP - creating functions, labels, writing code etc

arguments

locals + local jump + conditional jump

primitive get/set/ops - fixed (specific width) vs variable width and signed vs
unsigned and float vs int.

pure bitops - bitvectors, flag get/set, masking, bit iterators, chunking,
matching, shuffle.

row types

names are bitvectors, which should correspond to valid ★-char text.

interning - 64 bit index -> text object.
