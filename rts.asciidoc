The rts has a GOT and a bunch of function data structures.

The GOT comes with some bootstrapping functions.

It goes through an initialisation step, which includes populating the GOT with bootstrapping functions, then translates bytecode files into executable images, then runs them.

The rts is responsible for marshalling data for function calls, as well as setting up the scratch area and doing any internal link/trace patching.
